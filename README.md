# enviroscreen_2.0

## Colorado EnviroScreen
Colorado EnviroScreen is an interactive environmental justice mapping tool. Version 1.0 of Colorado EnviroScreen launched on June 28, 2022.

The tool enables users to identify disproportionately impacted communities based on the definition in Colorado’s [Environmental Justice Act](https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2021a_1266_signed.pdf) (HB21-1266) so that communities directly benefit from:

- Money and other resources. For example, CDPHE’s Environmental Justice Advisory Board will use EnviroScreen to determine where to distribute environmental justice grants created by the new law.

- Enhanced opportunities to participate in Air Quality Control Commission rulemaking and permitting decisions.

- Priority for enforcement and compliance initiatives under [an agreement](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14o0E-LhS7c_uzifH4xaztrmhJA9mh4Ia/view) between CDPHE and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
