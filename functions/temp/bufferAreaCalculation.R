# This method is designed to mirror the buffer approach from the 
# 2024 EJScreen technical documentation 
# --------------------------------------------
# Direct quotes from the ejscreen doc 
# 1. This formula is simply a population-weighted average â€“ it sums the 
# population-weighted raw values, and then divides that sum by the total 
# population in the buffer.
#
# 2. To provide the most accurate counts that are currently feasible for a 
# screening tool, EJScreen uses an approach based on decennial Census block 
# internal points. EJScreen estimates the fraction of the Census block group 
# population that is inside the buffer by using block-level population counts 
# from the decennial Census
#
# --------------------------------------------
# Summary of methods from quotes 
#
# - buffer distance is a user defined features 
# - generate a buffer, and select all block internal points with are within the
#   buffer object
# - Calculate the total population of all blocks
# - using selected block, select the total population and measured value for each 
#   block group 
# - Calculations occur for each unique block group
# - Numerator : (pop of select Blocks / pop of block group decadial) * pop of block group acs * measured value of block group
# - denominator : sum of all (pop of select Blocks / pop of block group decadial) * pop of block group acs
# - Full value; sum of all records values within block groups 


# move this to the processing sections ------------------------------------

  ### this is just returning the measureValue, which makes sense because it's the only feature 
  ### not on the top and bottom of the equation 
  
  ### the other though here is that there might be a different measured value depending on the
  ### census block used. This may or may not apply to some buffered datasets, but wouldn't matter for 
  ### for things like apens
